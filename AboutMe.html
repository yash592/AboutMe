	<p>Having always dreamt of taking to the skies, I set out for a quest to become an Aviator. But the dream was short lived as I failed a vital medical test. But that never held me back as I started a career in something which was always close to my heart. After a short stint in Eastern Europe I came to the land of opportunities and graduated with a dual degree. I went on to work as a consultant of a major agricultural company helping them with their CAD data management systems.<br>
    Outside of class and work I enjoy working out, cussing LA traffic and making my cat, Garfield's life a nightmare.
